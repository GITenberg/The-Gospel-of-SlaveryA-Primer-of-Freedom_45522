      How long is it since Southern papers advertised the offers of rival
      hunters of fugitive Negroes, who claimed that they had the best
      bloodhounds, &amp;c.? Truly an honorable and manly vocation. Runaway
      Slaves were advertised as having been torn by the dogs, thus and so, on
      former occasions of flight, and large rewards were offered for the capture
      of such ingrates, dead or alive! Shall not specimens of these
      advertisements be some day included in the literary curiosities of
      civilization?

      No. But it lies back of all these. It is found in the Atheistic Red

      Some persons sneer at any distinction between hirelings of a month or year
      and hirelings for life&mdash;the latter being their definition of Southern
      Slavery! A taste of the wormwood and the gall might bring them to exclaim
      with <i>Sterne</i>: "Disguise thyself as thou wilt, still Slavery, still
      thou art a bitter draught; and though thousands in all ages have been made
      to drink of thee, thou art no less bitter on that account." Suppose the
      chalice were commended to the lips of Slaveholders?

      The Constitution grants neither right nor authority to interfere with the
      domestic institutions of any State; but Congress, representing the people
      and the States, has absolute control in the Territories. "More Slavery!"
      has been the continual cry of the South. Rebellion provoked the war-power
      of the President; and it is now probable that the institution which
      claimed a continent, will be numbered with the abominations that <i>were!</i>
      Let all the people say Amen.

      The evils of Slavery to the <i>white</i> race, in a material sense, are
      clearly shown by statistics; but no one can reckon the low estate of
      education, religion, and morals, especially in the country-districts of
      the South. The larger the plantations are, the wider is the space between
      the white families; and an increase of the number of slaves, is no
      increase of exalting social intercourse. The mansion cannot escape the
      malaria of the hovels, nor can <i>any</i> one escape the just judgment of
      the Almighty.

      "The foundations of our new government are laid, its cornerstone rests
      upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man....
      This, our new government, is the first in the history of the world, based
      upon this great physical, philosophical and moral truth.... This stone
      which was rejected by the first builders, is become the chief stone of the

      an imperial decree, and our Republic is cutting a tangled knot by the edge
      of the sword. The loathing with which the Slave Trader has long been
      regarded, even in the South, was the index-finger of the hand of God. It
      is now a voice sounding in the darkness as a prophecy of coming day. Will
      not angels join the chorus of welcome? May the good Lord hasten the hour

      "Possibly that is true," was the reply, "but Northern ladies do not

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
